# Walmart-Sales-Analysis 

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Walmart's sales data using **Tableau**, focusing on key performance indicators such as **average sales measures, state-wise profit distribution, age vs. profit trends, and regional profitability**.  

- **Average Measures Analysis:** Calculated and visualized **average sales, profit, and discount** across different product categories and time periods, identifying trends in consumer spending.  
- **State vs. Profit Analysis:** Created a **geographical heatmap** to compare profit margins across different U.S. states, highlighting high-performing and underperforming regions.  
- **Age vs. Profit Insights:** Analyzed customer age groups against profit margins to determine which demographics contributed most to sales growth, helping in targeted marketing strategies.  
- **Regional Profit Distribution:** Designed **interactive bar and pie charts** to showcase profitability across different regions, enabling insights into region-specific sales performance.  

This analysis helped in understanding **profitability drivers, sales patterns, and customer demographics**, providing actionable insights for optimizing pricing, marketing, and inventory strategies.
